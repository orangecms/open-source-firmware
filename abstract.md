Firmware is found in all computing devices, including PCs, laptops, networking equipment, printers, embedded devices such as IoT and industrial controllers, mobile phones, tablets, and more. The community around open source firmware has grown over the last years, allowing for more exchange in the development and granting freedom to end users. Prominent projects like U-Boot, Tianocore, coreboot and others teach how firmware works and welcome contributions. This talk provides a brief introduction into firmware, an overview of the general build process, a perception of the current state of development on two platforms, an end user report, and a summary of the first Open Source Firmware Conference, which was supported by the openSUSE project.
